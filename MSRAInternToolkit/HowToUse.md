**MSRA Intern Toolkit â€“ How to Submit a Job**

*Author: ZhiYuan Feng*

This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to submit a job using the MSRA Intern Toolkit in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Follow the instructions below to ensure a successful job submission process.

---

## 1. Select a Cluster
1. **Choose Cluster**: Select the desired cluster from the list of available options.  
2. **Set Virtual Cluster**: Specify which virtual cluster your job will run on.  
3. **Configure Workspace**: Select or create the workspace where the job will be executed.  
4. **Specify Instance Type**: Choose the machine type best suited for your job.  
5. **Select Number of Nodes**: Indicate how many machines (nodes) are needed.  
6. **Pick SLA Tier**:
   - **Premium**  
   - **Standard**  
   - **Basic**  

   > *Note*: The SLA Tier determines service level and cost.  

7. **Location**: Choose the default location or another preferred region if available.

## 2. IO (Input/Output) Configuration
1. **Database Selection**: Typically, a Blob datastore is used.  
2. **Name**: Use the name `environment` (or another meaningful name) to identify this I/O setting.  
3. **Datastore**: Select the corresponding datastore that points to your blob storage.  
4. **Path**: Provide the exact path corresponding to your blob container or folder.  
5. **Mode**: Choose one of the following access modes:
   - **Read**  
   - **Write**  
   - **Mount**  

   > *Read* gives read-only access, *Write* allows writing, and *Mount* attaches the blob storage as a folder accessible to your environment.

## 3. Environment Configuration
Choose the appropriate environment based on your hardware requirements:
- **AMD**: For CPU or AMD-based machines.  
- **NVIDIA**: For jobs that require GPU acceleration.  

Make sure to pick the correct environment image so your job can run properly (e.g., CUDA libraries for GPU jobs).

---

## 4. Experiment Setup
1. **Experiment Name**: Give your experiment a clear name (e.g., `hoi_experiment_v1`).  
2. **Job Name**: Name your job to help distinguish it from other jobs (e.g., `hoi_training_run1`).  

These names will help you organize and identify your experiments and their associated results.

---

## 5. Managed Identity (Optional)
If you need credentials or permissions to access certain resources, configure the **Managed Identity** settings. This ensures your job can securely interact with external services or data sources without hard-coding credentials.

---

## 6. Script Setup and Submission
You can provide a custom script to run once your environment is active. Below is a reference script that clones a GitHub repository, sets environment variables, and initiates the training process.

```bash
PAT=github_pat_....

cd /tmp
git clone https://$PAT@github.com/AaronFengZY/HOI_moge.git
cd HOI_moge
git checkout hoimoge
ln -s ${{blobmnt_fzy}} blobmnt

export GRADIENT_ACCUMULATION_STEPS=1
export BATCH_SIZE_FORWARD=2
export NUM_MACHINES=4
export NUM_PROCESSES=32
export CONFIG=configs/revision/fzy_ft/vitl_contitrain.json
export WORKSPACE=blobmnt/workspace/fzy_ft/vitl_contitrain
export CHECKPOINT=latest
export SCRIPT=scripts/train/train.py
export GRADIENT_CHECKPOINTING=True

sh scripts/shell/train.sh
```

### Notes on the Script:
1. **Authentication**: Set your personal access token (`PAT`) to allow GitHub operations.  
2. **Cloning Repository**: The script clones the `HOI_moge` repo from GitHub and checks out a specific branch (`hoimoge`).  
3. **Blob Storage Mount**: `ln -s ${{blobmnt_fzy}} blobmnt` links your blob mount path inside the container.  
4. **Environment Variables**:
   - `GRADIENT_ACCUMULATION_STEPS`, `BATCH_SIZE_FORWARD`, `NUM_MACHINES`, `NUM_PROCESSES`, etc. allow you to easily configure training parameters.  
   - `CONFIG` points to your training configuration file.  
   - `WORKSPACE` is set to the path where artifacts (checkpoints, logs, etc.) will be saved.  
5. **Launch Script**: Finally, it executes `train.sh` which initiates the model training.

---

## Finalizing Your Job Submission
Once you have completed the configuration steps above and provided your script, you can proceed to **Submit** your job. The MSRA Intern Toolkit will queue your job in the selected cluster. You can then monitor its progress and access logs or artifacts upon completion.
